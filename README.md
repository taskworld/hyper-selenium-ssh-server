# hyper-selenium-ssh-server

Like [`rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd:18.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd/) but you can specify the root password by passing environment variable `$SSH_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

Intended to be used with [hyper-selenium](https://github.com/taskworld/hyper-selenium) but can also be used for other purposes as well, I guess?
